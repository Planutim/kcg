Atlas is a pixel array
Atlas starts empty
Sprites are copied to Atlas and we get a AtlasSpriteId

SetTileTexture(TileSpriteId, 2,10) //2nd row, 10th column of TileSpriteId
- What does this do?
-- It blits (copy) the Sprite from TileSpriteLoader (TileSpriteSheetId)
-- to the TileSpriteAtlas
-- AND get the AtlasSpriteId (index into the Atlas texture sheet)

SetTileId(5)
// TileType, TileLayer, Name
DefineTile(BlockTypeSolid, LayerForegound, "regolith");
SetTileTexture(ImageId2, 2,10); //2nd row, 10th column, of i
push_texture(); //some might have more than one

SetTilePropertyIsExplosive(true); //example
SetTileDurability(60);

SetTileTextDescription("Regolith is a kind of dust commonly found on the surface of astronomical objects,\n");
EndTile();
